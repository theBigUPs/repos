00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:20,160
Saga

00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:29,080
Saga

3
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,700
Saga

4
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,040
Yeah

5
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,500
Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran

6
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,800
Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran

7
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,680
Alone in the middle of the night

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,180
Woah

9
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,900
Painting my lips with the brightest of reds

10
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,400
Woah

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,220
Tonight, will you come? Won’t you?

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,420
How many flower petals have I plucked?

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,460
Bellflower bellflower

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,519
As my patience seems to leave me

15
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,080
An imprisoned harlequinade

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,140
Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran

17
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,280
Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,060
Have you heard of the flawless beauty

19
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:21,800
Woah

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,420
Makes rumors that start up quickly

21
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:23,920
Woah

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,860
And in my misery and depravity your hand will be taken

23
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,820
Satisfaction! (Satisfaction!)

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,320
I won’t put up with love and hate’s entwining dance

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,399
In sorrow! (In sorrow!)

26
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,940
Oh Trouble

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,479
A distressed butterfly’s zealous dance

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,600
Magic spell, spell, spell, spell

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,820
I want to bind us together with fresh red blood

30
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,839
A rose’s thorn, thorn, thorn

31
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,120
From Mitsuse Pass to Tawarazaka

32
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,620
And beyond

33
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,200
I’d even come to meet you in hell

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,260
But the wind blows, it hails, and you escape

35
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,480
Come to me

36
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,880
Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,980
Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran

38
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,100
Like I’m your average girl strutting downtown

39
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,600
Woah

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,259
Though pick-up lines are flying past me

41
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,760
Woah

42
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,720
I’m the only one being shunned; come and pick up

43
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,760
It’s hard! (Hard!)

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,000
Traveling the whole rest of the country

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,240
Come over! (Come over!)

46
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,720
Welcome

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,280
A teary field of flowers in full bloom

48
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,460
Binding spell, spell, spell, spell

49
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,700
The heat of eternal burial that cannot pass

50
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,619
A rose’s thorn, thorn, thorn

51
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,900
My insides dried up and shrivelling

52
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,460
Burning

53
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,120
Water me before I wither away

54
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,840
You’ll come, you won’t, you’ll come, you’ll love, autumn rain

55
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,860
Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran

56
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,000
Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran

57
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,440
Stop! I want to wash away our wish to die together

58
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,380
Binding spell, spell, spell, spell

59
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,400
A solitary song bird, I want to be rewarded

60
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,360
If I’m not fated to meet you

61
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,660
I’ll impatiently pass the time waiting

62
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,920
A distressed butterfly’s zealous dance

63
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,119
Binding spell, spell, spell, spell

64
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,320
I want to bind us together with fresh red blood

65
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,220
A rose’s thorn, thorn, thorn

66
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,560
From Mitsuse Pass to Tawarazaka

67
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,060
And beyond

68
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,740
I’d even come to meet you in hell

69
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,260
But the wind blows, it hails, you escape, come to me

70
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,280
You’ll come, you won’t, come here, come now

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,280
To a sweet, far-off eternity

72
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,440
Embrace me, hold me, I want to be in your arms

73
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,680
Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran Chikiran

74
